## Description

 In this project we worked on setting up a library with a class Employee using constrictors and then Expanded that class to other classes Engineer, Intern, and Manager. We were supposed to start with test, but basically took the classes built and put tests around them. The tests were pretty basic tests, the point of those seems to make your job replaceable but perhaps I'll see the point of them as I get more familiar with coding. Next we pulled all the required imports into our index.js and created functions that returnted info we wanted to gather and return into our generateHTML.js file.
